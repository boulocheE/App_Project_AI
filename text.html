<h1>Data Challenge</h1>
    <p>Antoine Montier<br>NE<strong>FMQN90</strong></p>

    <p>In this notebook, you will find all the steps I used to detect and classify a road sign on an image.<br>
    This notebook is the result of many python scripts, many models, many other notebooks and a lot of researches.</p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>Here, you are in the <code>src/predict_from_scratch</code> where I show from the very beginning how to predict. Here are other directories you might be interested in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>src/Data_augmentation</code>: This directory is the one I used to augment data. I explain how & why to have the same amount of data for each category. I augmented twice the data. Make sure you check <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/src/Data_augmentation/data-augmentation.ipynb">this notebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/src/Data_augmentation/data-augmentation-bis.ipynb">this one</a>. I also used <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/src/Data_augmentation/data-zoomer.py">this script</a> to generate some zoomed images but it ended up being inacurate.</li>
        <li><code>src/pannel_locator</code>: This directory is focused on the shape classification. It's helpful in the filtering process to know where a sign is and if the shape is circular enough to run our sign model on it. Check <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/src/pannel_locator/shape-recognizer.ipynb">this notebook</a> to learn more about it.</li>
        <li><code>src/Pannel_recognizer</code>: This directory is the one I used to create a model. Check <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/src/Pannel_recognizer/model-maker.py">this script</a> That I used to create our <code>best_model.h5</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also find, in the <code>Training</code> directory what I trained my model on. Some images are about the <strong>gtrsb</strong> dataset. Most of the picture are from me: I screenshooted a lot of them on google street view. You can find some informations at the very bottom of <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/src/Data_augmentation/data-augmentation.ipynb">this notebook</a> or <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/dataset.md">here</a>.</p>

    <p>There's a <code>useless</code> directory that I kept <em>in the case</em> but it's still useless. It was some part of my work that ended up useless.</p>

    <p>The <code>models</code> directory is where I store my shape / road-sign models. feel free to test them</p>

    <p>The <code>img</code> directory contains some full images containing (or not) road sign to test the model.</p>

    <p>Run <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/src/predict_from_scratch/predict_from_scratch.py">this python script</a> from the <code>src/predict_from_scratch</code> directory (or edit the path in the script) to have an overview of the model on some photos</p>

    <p>There are some unfolded files in the root directory. For example <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/none.sh">none.sh</a> helped me to create <strong>generic filenames</strong> & <a href="https://github.com/antoineMontier/Road-Sign-Recognition/tree/main/pot_sources.txt">pot_sources.txt</a> was created at the very beginning when I stored some potential sources for my project. I looked some of them but none of them inspired me, I found them more difficult than the processes used during the classes/homeworks.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>

    <p>My road sign model is great (it has a <strong>val_accuracy > 0.90</strong>) but the issue (what I would have worked on if I had more time) is that the pannel_locator model isn't very accurate. it sometimes recognizes signs where there's no sign and is very sensitive to a <strong>red background</strong> or <strong>sign viewed from aside</strong></p>

    <h2>Good usage</h2>

    <p><strong>This sign inside a picture will be recognized</strong></p>

    <p><strong>This sign has a red background: no edges ; maybe no recognition</strong></p>

    <p><strong>This sign is viewed from aside: Elliptic shape ; maybe no recognition</strong></p>
